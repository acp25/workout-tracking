This application is a Full Stack Web Application which allow the user to register workouts and the related exercises. The app keeps information like duration, weight, repetitions and distance, in order to display a useful dashboard to show the user's workouts progress.


## User Story

With the described process we were able to create a useful, efficient, responsive, and engaging application.
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
